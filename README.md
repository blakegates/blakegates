# Welcome to My GitHub

Hi, I’m Blake, an information security professional diving deeper into the world of development and tools that enhance productivity. My current focus areas include:

- **Neovim**: Mastering configurations, plugins, and workflows.
- **Python**: For automation, scripting, and expanding my skillset.
- **Go**: Exploring a powerful, efficient, and modern programming language.

## Projects and Goals

This space serves as my repository for projects, notes, and configurations as I progress through my journey. Expect to find:

- **Neovim Configurations**: Custom setups and plugin integrations.
- **Python Projects**: Scripts and tools relevant to my work and interests.
- **Go Experiments**: Learning the language through small projects and hands-on exploration.

## About Me

With a background in information security, I enjoy solving problems and learning new technologies that improve workflows and systems. This repository is both a record of my learning process and a way to share ideas with others.
