# World, Hello.

An information security professional diving deeper into the world of development and tools that enhance productivity. 

Current cool things I'm checkin' out:

- **Neovim**: Learning and mastering configurations, plugins, and workflows that work for me.
- **Python**: Pretty much for automation, scripting, and expanding my skillset.
- **Go**: Exploring a powerful, efficient, and modern language.

## Projects and Goals

- **Neovim Configurations** - Always a WIP
- **Python Projects** - More to come
- **Go Projects** - My main project focus for 2025
